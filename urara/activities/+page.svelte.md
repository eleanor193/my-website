## Speaking & Volunteering
### From volunteer...
- While at Monash, I volunteered at four Open Days during studies, speaking to prospective students and providing course advice:

### ...to alumni speaker!
- In a full-circle moment, I was invited back to Monash to share my career journey and student experience as a Media Communication alumna:

### Global Ambassador
- As the proud Global Ambassador of Monash, I worked with the International Student Engagement team to organise events for students as well as team members through the aims of four core pillars - Development, Networking, Publicity, and Wellbeing.
- Here, I'm speaking to commencing international students at the [Pre-arrival briefing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeC-_j14-IQ):
