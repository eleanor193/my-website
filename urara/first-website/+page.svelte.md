I’ve done everything from creating high-impact resources to generating new leads through marketing – but nothing has been quite as satisfying as building an entirely new website for my company.

This was part of our Rebranding project: a top-to-bottom transformation of our visual identity to match our growing range of services. And at the heart of that rebrand was a brand new website that brought everything together.

Here’s how it happened:

- Translating ideas into a clear vision for the website
- Mapping out structure and content
- Building and iterating 🛠️

The site runs on WordPress with an army of plugins – think forms, analytics, spam-cleaning and more – to keep things running satisfactorily (plugins, however, have their own pitfalls). For the visual build, Elementor Pro (plus some add-ons) was the way to go.

The drag-and-drop widgets got us pretty far, but when it came to the finer customisations, it was time to roll up my sleeves and dive into code.

Under the hood was:

- `HTML/CSS` – for the visual layout and design flair
- `JavaScript` – to add interactivity and dynamic behaviour
- `PHP` – to customise the theme, handle form submissions and manage privacy/authentication

Of course, a shiny front-end is only half the job. A functional, professional site needs a lot more behind the scenes:

- `Mobile responsiveness` – because what looks good on your laptop might look like a jigsaw puzzle on a phone
- `Form validation` – so users don’t accidentally (or purposely) break things
- `Crash monitoring` – to catch and fix issues before anyone else notices
- `Backend management` – think databases, cache control and keeping the bad guys out 🔐

Before I started this project, I had *no idea* just how much goes into building and maintaining a website. Now it’s safe to say I’ve gone from rookie to seasoned soldier.

Challenging? Absolutely.

Rewarding? Even more so.

Would I do it again? Absolutely!
