**Hello, xin chào, hola, 你好 – I’m Eleanor, and thanks for stopping by!**

I’m a Marketing & Communications professional with a deep curiosity for AI. I graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor of Media Communication, specialising in Media & Journalism, and was honoured to receive the Arts Award for Best Overall Student in my course.

My journey into tech began while I was working in my first full-time marketing role. Around that time, I started tinkering with AI tools and became instantly hooked. I became fascinated by how AI works and its potential to transform how we communicate, learn and solve problems. I believe that when developed and used ethically, AI can help tackle some of society’s most complex challenges.

Recently, I took a bold step: I left my job to focus on learning, building and exploring more opportunities in the tech space.

Right now, I’m especially interested in:

- applying machine learning and data science in marketing – from data-driven insights to workflow automation and chatbots  
- building or integrating AI that improves people’s lives – especially in areas like education (language learning is a personal passion), business and healthcare

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me:

- reading (I’m on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86487085-eleanor-truong)!)
- learning languages (yes, I do consider this a hobby)
- writing  
- dancing and running  
- cooking  
- playing chess (still working on my openings…)

I also write on [Substack](https://eleanortruong.substack.com/) about the intersection of technology, education, languages, and how they shape the way we connect and grow (though I don’t post as often as I’d like!).

I’m always keen to connect with like-minded people. If you share these interests – or just want to chat – feel free to reach out at [nguyethatrg@gmail.com](mailto:nguyethatrg@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eleanor-truong-956b26190/).
